Things to fix list:



Translate untranslated furnitures like beds and stoves
Translate untranslated thoughts like "eating off the ground"
Translate things like medikit and uranium
Think of a way to express "eat at XXX" with Chinese in the form of "Verb Noun"

(Right now it's eat nutrient paste dispenser, lol)
Remove the extra {0} infront of all research names
Translate untranslated research finished message
Fix "dead body of""race", the race part is in English
