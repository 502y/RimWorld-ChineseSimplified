  <TribeCivil.label>gentle tribe</TribeCivil.label>
  <TribeCivil.description>These people have been here a very long time. Maybe their ancestors crashed here a thousand years ago. Maybe they survived some cataclysm that destroyed a technological civilization here. In any case, the tribals are mostly nomadic people who live off the land using primitive tools and weapons.\n\nDespite their apparent technological weakness, the tribals can be dangerous enemies and valuable friends because of their skill with low-tech warfare, their numbers, and their hardiness.\n\nThis particular tribe pursues a gentle way of life where they can. They are quite open to trade and alliances, even with strange peoples.</TribeCivil.description>

  <Pirate.label>海盗团</Pirate.label>
  <Pirate.description>一个强盗组织。\n\n海盗们不播种，不建设，也很少会做贸易。他们基本靠掠夺与抢劫区域内的其他活跃组织使自己变为富有。\n\n他们的科技水平取决于最近成功地偷了谁。大部分时间下他们使用火器，有些幸运儿可能会使用更高级的能量武器，还有一些可能更喜欢近身用刀捅人。</Pirate.description>

  <!--<Outlander.description>这些人可能已经在这里生活了数十年甚至上百年，之前所掌握的大部分科技成果基本都已经失传了。他们现在通常使用简单的机械工具，并使用高级的火药武器来防御自己。\n\n他们比较关心诸如贸易、信任以及生存等更为实际一些的事情。</Outlander.description>-->

  <!--<Tribe.label>部落</Tribe.label>-->
  <!--<Tribe.description>这些人们在这里已经存在了很长时间了。也许他们的祖先于千年以前在这里坠毁过，也可能是从某场毁灭文明的大灾难中所幸存下来的。不管怎样，这些部落原住民大部分是生活于这里的游牧民族，他们使用着原始的工具和武器。\n\n有些原住民比其他的更具备攻击性，而大部分都愿意做贸易往来以及结盟，即便是同你这样的陌生人。由于你和他们在社会结构上差别迥异，并且语言交流也存在障碍，使得密切合作或者招降他们变得极为困难。\n\n尽管他们的科技发展非常弱，但原住民依然可能是危险的敌人或者是有价值的盟友，因为毕竟他们对低端武器非常熟练，人还多，而且十分坚强。</Tribe.description>-->
